/**
 * Given a string of lowercase alphabets and a number k,
 * the task is to print the minimum value of the string after removal of ‘k’ characters.
 * The value of a string is defined as the sum of squares of the count of each distinct character.
 * Example:
 * Input : str = abccc, K = 1
 * Output : 6
 * We remove c to get the value as 11 + 11 + 22
 *
 * Input:
 * First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of String s. Second line of every test case consists of a integer K.
 *
 * Output:
 * Single line output, Print the minimum square sum.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=T<=100
 * 1<=|String length|<=100
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * abccc
 * 1
 * abccc
 * 2
 * Output:
 * 6
 * 3
