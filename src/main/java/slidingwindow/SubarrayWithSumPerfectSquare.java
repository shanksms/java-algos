/**
 * Given an array arr[] and an integer K, the task is to find a subarray of length K having
 * sum which is a perfect square. If no such subarray exists, then print -1. Otherwise, print the subarray.
 *
 * Note: There can be more than one possible subarray. Print any one of them.
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {20, 34, 51, 10, 99, 87, 23, 45}, K = 3
 * Output: {10, 99, 87}
 * Explanation: Sum of the elements of the subarray {10, 99, 87} is 196 which is a perfect square (162 = 196).
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {20, 34, 51, 10, 99, 87, 23, 45}, K = 4
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: None of the subarrays of size K has a sum which is a perfect square.
